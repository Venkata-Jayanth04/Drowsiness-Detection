# Drowsiness-Detection

Overview
Drowsiness while driving is a major cause of road accidents, leading to injuries and fatalities. This project aims to develop a real-time drowsiness detection system using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once v3), an advanced deep learning-based object detection model. The system continuously monitors a driver's eyes and mouth movements to detect signs of drowsiness and issues an alert if necessary.

Features
Real-time detection of drowsiness using a webcam.
YOLOv3-based object detection for recognizing closed eyes and yawning.
Alert system that triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected.
High accuracy and efficiency using deep learning techniques.
Optimized for real-time performance with OpenCV and TensorFlow.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (for image and video processing)
TensorFlow 2.13.0 (for deep learning model training and inference)
YOLOv3 (for object detection)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
NumPy (for numerical computations)

Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
