# Drowsiness-Detection

## Overview
##### Drowsiness while driving is a major cause of road accidents, leading to injuries and fatalities. This project aims to develop a real-time drowsiness detection system using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once v3), an advanced deep learning-based object detection model. The system continuously monitors a driver's eyes and mouth movements to detect signs of drowsiness and issues an alert if necessary.

## Features
##### Real-time detection of drowsiness using a webcam.
##### YOLOv3-based object detection for recognizing closed eyes and yawning.
##### Alert system that triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected.
##### High accuracy and efficiency using deep learning techniques.
##### Optimized for real-time performance with OpenCV and TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used
##### Python
##### OpenCV (for image and video processing)
##### TensorFlow 2.13.0 (for deep learning model training and inference)
##### YOLOv3 (for object detection)
##### Matplotlib (for data visualization)
##### NumPy (for numerical computations)

## Installation
##### pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model-Performance
##### Train Accuracy: 98%
##### Test Accuracy: 97%
##### Training Loss: 0.04 (4%)
##### Validation Loss: 0.05 (5%)

## How It Works
##### The system captures a video feed from a webcam.
##### It detects the eyes and mouth using the YOLOv3 model.
##### If the eyes remain closed for a certain duration, the system identifies drowsiness.
##### If yawning is detected, the system increases the drowsiness score.
##### If the drowsiness score crosses a threshold, an alarm is triggered.
